This is an outdated personal web page.  I created this webpage to showcase projects and experience 
while attempting to get an internship during spring 2015 (SUCCESSFUL).


I will begin updating this to use libraries such as three.js and jQuery API.  I hope to have it updated by April 2015 to 
showcase all current projects.
